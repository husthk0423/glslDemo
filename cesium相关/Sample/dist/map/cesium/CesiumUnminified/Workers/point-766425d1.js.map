Mantyla, An Introduction\n * to Sold Modeling, Computer Science Press, Rockville, Maryland, 1988).\n *\n * The fundamental data structure is the \"half-edge\".  Two half-edges\n * go together to make an edge, but they point in opposite directions.\n * Each half-edge has a pointer to its mate (the \"symmetric\" half-edge Sym),\n * its origin vertex (Org), the face on its left side (Lface), and the\n * adjacent half-edges in the CCW direction around the origin vertex\n * (Onext) and around the left face (Lnext).  There is also a \"next\"\n * pointer for the global edge list (see below).\n *\n * The notation used for mesh navigation:\n *  Sym   = the mate of a half-edge (same edge, but opposite direction)\n *  Onext = edge CCW around origin vertex (keep same origin)\n *  Dnext = edge CCW around destination vertex (keep same dest)\n *  Lnext = edge CCW around left face (dest becomes new origin)\n *  Rnext = edge CCW around right face (origin becomes new dest)\n *\n * \"prev\" means to substitute CW for CCW in the definitions above.\n *\n * The mesh keeps global lists of all vertices, faces, and edges,\n * stored as doubly-linked circular lists with a dummy header node.\n * The mesh stores pointers to these dummy headers (vHead, fHead, eHead).\n *\n * The circular edge list is special; since half-edges always occur\n * in pairs (e and e->Sym), each half-edge stores a pointer in only\n * one direction.  Starting at eHead and following the e->next pointers\n * will visit each *edge* once (ie. e or e->Sym, but not both).\n * e->Sym stores a pointer in the opposite direction, thus it is\n * always true that e->Sym->next->Sym->next == e.\n *\n * Each vertex has a pointer to next and previous vertices in the\n * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this vertex as\n * the origin (NULL if this is the dummy header).  There is also a\n * field \"data\" for client data.\n *\n * Each face has a pointer to the next and previous faces in the\n * circular list, and a pointer to a half-edge with this face as\n * the left face (NULL if this is the dummy header).  There is also\n * a field \"data\" for client data.\n *\n * Note that what we call a \"face\" is really a loop; faces may consist\n * of more than one loop (ie. not simply connected), but there is no\n * record of this in the data structure.  The mesh may consist of\n * several disconnected regions, so it may not be possible to visit\n * the entire mesh by starting at a half-edge and traversing the edge\n * structure.\n *\n * The mesh does NOT support isolated vertices; a vertex is deleted along\n * with its last edge.  Similarly when two faces are merged, one of the\n * faces is deleted (see tessMeshDelete below).  For mesh operations,\n * all face (loop) and vertex pointers must not be NULL.  However, once\n * mesh manipulation is finished, TESSmeshZapFace can be used to delete\n * faces of the mesh, one at a time.  All external faces can be \"zapped\"\n * before the mesh is returned to the client; then a NULL face indicates\n * a region which is not part of the output polygon.\n */\n\nfunction TESSvertex() {\n    this.next = null;\t/* next vertex (never NULL) */\n    this.prev = null;\t/* previous vertex (never NULL) */\n    this.anEdge = null;\t/* a half-edge with this origin */\n\n\t/* Internal data (keep hidden) */\n    this.coords = [0,0,0];\t/* vertex location in 3D */\n    this.s = 0.0;\n    this.t = 0.0;\t\t\t/* projection onto the sweep plane */\n    this.pqHandle = 0;\t\t/* to allow deletion from priority queue */\n    this.n = 0;\t\t\t\t/* to allow identify unique vertices */\n    this.idx = 0;\t\t\t/* to allow map result to original verts */\n}\n\nfunction TESSface() {\n    this.next = null;\t\t/* next face (never NULL) */\n    this.prev = null;\t\t/* previous face (never NULL) */\n    this.anEdge = null;\t\t/* a half edge with this left face */\n\n\t/* Internal data (keep hidden) */\n    this.trail = null;\t\t/* \"stack\" for conversion to strips */\n    this.n = 0;\t\t\t\t/* to allow identiy unique faces */\n    this.marked = false;\t/* flag for conversion to strips */\n    this.inside = false;\t/* this face is in the polygon interior */\n};\n\nfunction TESShalfEdge(side) {\n    this.next = null;\t\t/* doubly-linked list (prev==Sym->next) */\n    this.Sym = null;\t\t/* same edge, opposite direction */\n    this.Onext = null;\t\t/* next edge CCW around origin */\n    this.Lnext = null;\t\t/* next edge CCW around left face */\n    this.Org = null;\t\t/* origin vertex (Overtex too long) */\n    this.Lface = null;\t\t/* left face */\n\n\t/* Internal data (keep hidden) */\n    this.activeRegion = null;\t/* a region with this upper edge (sweep.c) */\n    this.winding = 0;\t\t\t/* change in winding number when crossing\n\t from the right face to the left face */\n    this.side = side;\n};\n\nTESShalfEdge.prototype = {\n    get Rface() { return this.Sym.Lface; },\n    set Rface(v) { this.Sym.Lface = v; },\n    get Dst() { return this.Sym.Org; },\n    set Dst(v) { this.Sym.Org = v; },\n    get Oprev() { return this.Sym.Lnext; },\n    set Oprev(v) { this.Sym.Lnext = v; },\n    get Lprev() { return this.Onext.Sym; },\n    set Lprev(v) { this.Onext.Sym = v; },\n    get Dprev() { return this.Lnext.Sym; },\n    set Dprev(v) { this.Lnext.Sym = v; },\n    get Rprev() { return this.Sym.Onext; },\n    set Rprev(v) { this.Sym.Onext = v; },\n    get Dnext() { return /*this.Rprev*/this.Sym.Onext.Sym; },  /* 3 pointers */\n    set Dnext(v) { /*this.Rprev*/this.Sym.Onext.Sym = v; },  /* 3 pointers */\n    get Rnext() { return /*this.Oprev*/this.Sym.Lnext.Sym; },  /* 3 pointers */\n    set Rnext(v) { /*this.Oprev*/this.Sym.Lnext.Sym = v; },  /* 3 pointers */\n};\n\n\n\nfunction TESSmesh() {\n    var v = new TESSvertex();\n    var f = new TESSface();\n    var e = new TESShalfEdge(0);\n    var eSym = new TESShalfEdge(1);\n\n    v.next = v.prev = v;\n    v.anEdge = null;\n\n    f.next = f.prev = f;\n    f.anEdge = null;\n    f.trail = null;\n    f.marked = false;\n    f.inside = false;\n\n    e.next = e;\n    e.Sym = eSym;\n    e.Onext = null;\n    e.Lnext = null;\n    e.Org = null;\n    e.Lface = null;\n    e.winding = 0;\n    e.activeRegion = null;\n\n    eSym.next = eSym;\n    eSym.Sym = e;\n    eSym.Onext = null;\n    eSym.Lnext = null;\n    eSym.Org = null;\n    eSym.Lface = null;\n    eSym.winding = 0;\n    eSym.activeRegion = null;\n\n    this.vHead = v;\t\t/* dummy header for vertex list */\n    this.fHead = f;\t\t/* dummy header for face list */\n    this.eHead = e;\t\t/* dummy header for edge list */\n    this.eHeadSym = eSym;\t/* and its symmetric counterpart */\n};\n\n/* The mesh operations below have three motivations: completeness,\n * convenience, and efficiency.

As a convenience,\n * when a face is split, the \"inside\" flag is copied from the old face.\n * Other internal data (v->data, v->activeRegion, f->data, f->marked,\n * f->trail, e->winding) is set to zero.\n *\n * ********************** Basic Edge Operations **************************\n *\n * tessMeshMakeEdge( mesh ) creates one edge, two vertices, and a loop.\n * The loop (face) consists of the two new half-edges.\n *\n * tessMeshSplice( eOrg, eDst ) is the basic operation for changing the\n * mesh connectivity and topology.  It changes the mesh so that\n *  eOrg->Onext <- OLD( eDst->Onext )\n *  eDst->Onext <- OLD( eOrg->Onext )\n * where OLD(...) means the value before the meshSplice operation.\n *\n * This can have two effects on the vertex structure:\n *  - if eOrg->Org != eDst->Org, the two vertices are merged together\n *  - if eOrg->Org == eDst->Org, the origin is split into two vertices\n * In both cases, eDst->Org is changed and eOrg->Org is untouched.\n *\n * Similarly (and independently) for the face structure,\n *  - if eOrg->Lface == eDst->Lface, one loop is split into two\n *  - if eOrg->Lface != eDst->Lface, two distinct loops are joined into one\n * In both cases, eDst->Lface is changed and eOrg->Lface is unaffected.\n *\n * tessMeshDelete( eDel ) removes the edge eDel.  There are several cases:\n * if (eDel->Lface != eDel->Rface), we join two loops into one; the loop\n * eDel->Lface is deleted.  Otherwise, we are splitting one loop into two;\n * the newly created loop will contain eDel->Dst.  If the deletion of eDel\n * would create isolated vertices, those are deleted as well.\n *\n * ********************** Other Edge Operations **************************\n *\n * tessMeshAddEdgeVertex( eOrg ) creates a new edge eNew such that\n * eNew == eOrg->Lnext, and eNew->Dst is a newly created vertex.\n * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.\n *\n * tessMeshSplitEdge( eOrg ) splits eOrg into two edges eOrg and eNew,\n * such that eNew == eOrg->Lnext.  The new vertex is eOrg->Dst == eNew->Org.\n * eOrg and eNew will have the same left face.\n *\n * tessMeshConnect( eOrg, eDst ) creates a new edge from eOrg->Dst\n * to eDst->Org, and returns the corresponding half-edge eNew.\n * If eOrg->Lface == eDst->Lface, this splits one loop into two,\n * and the newly created loop is eNew->Lface.  Otherwise, two disjoint\n * loops are merged into one, and the loop eDst->Lface is destroyed.\n *\n * ************************ Other Operations *****************************\n *\n * tessMeshNewMesh() creates a new mesh with no edges, no vertices,\n * and no loops (what we usually call a \"face\").\n *\n * tessMeshUnion( mesh1, mesh2 ) forms the union of all structures in\n * both meshes, and returns the new mesh (the old meshes are destroyed).\n *\n * tessMeshDeleteMesh( mesh ) will free all storage for any valid mesh.\n *\n * tessMeshZapFace( fZap ) destroys a face and removes it from the\n * global face list.
